<p>
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Sussex in the
<a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/foss/">
  Foundations of Software Systems Group</a> working on functional programming with interaction nets
under the supervision
of <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p212026-ian-mackie">Prof. Ian Mackie</a>.
</p>

<p>

<p> 
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away <a href="https://https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"> (aka Manchester, 1994) </a> I got a BSc in Computer Science where I learnt to program in Pascal, Prolog and ML.
<p>

<p> 
I prompty left computing and went into the not-so glitzy world of investment banking.  After several twists and turns including getting an MBA from <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/"> (the Wharton School at UPenn) </a>, I ended up as the Chief Financial Officer of a cycling apparel <a href="https://www.assos.com/"> company </a> in beautiful Ticino, Switzerland.
<p>

<p> 
But now I'm back in the world of theoretical computer science!
